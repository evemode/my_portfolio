### 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

Objective:  
Predict customer churn to support proactive retention strategies.

Highlights:
- End-to-end ML pipeline  
- Comparison of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP  
- Business-driven threshold optimization (recall-focused)  
- SHAP-based model explainability  
- Deployment via interactive Dash application  

Final Model:  
Random Forest — best balance between Recall and F1-score  

Tech stack:  
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Dash · SHAP · Joblib · Poetry
